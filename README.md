#Wordpress Capistrano Deploy

This is a recipe for deploying your local WordPress environment, database and
all, to your staging(playground) and production servers. You can refer to
Theme.FM's tutorial to get a good idea on where to start, but I've made a good
bit of modifications, namely in the database arena. [Check out those tutorials
here.][1]

Happy Deploying!
